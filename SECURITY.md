- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Account lockout mechanism

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Zod schema validation for all inputs

### 5. Rate Limiting
- ✅ General API rate limiting (100 req/15min)
- ✅ Authentication rate limiting (5 attempts/15min)
- ✅ Strict rate limiting for sensitive operations
- ✅ IP-based tracking with cleanup

### 6. Database Security

- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Error tracking and reporting
- ✅ Request tracing with unique IDs

### 8. API Security
- ✅ Request timeout limits
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Request ID tracking
- ✅ Error handling without stack trace exposure
- ✅ Status code validation

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   - [ ] Generate strong auth secret (32+ characters)
   - [ ] Configure production database URL
   - [ ] Set secure cookie domain
   - [ ] Enable HTTPS in production
   - [ ] Configure SMTP for email notifications

2. **Database Security**
   - [ ] Use connection pooling
   - [ ] Enable SSL/TLS connections
   - [ ] Set up database backups
   - [ ] Configure read replicas if needed
   - [ ] Review database permissions

3. **Application Security**
   - [ ] Enable security headers
   - [ ] Configure CORS properly
   - [ ] Set up rate limiting
   - [ ] Configure logging level
   - [ ] Review authentication settings

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   - [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS certificates
   - [ ] Configure firewall rules
   - [ ] Set up DDoS protection
   - [ ] Configure load balancer
   - [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts

### Production Environment Variables

```bash
# Authentication
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_strong_32_char_secret_here
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db?sslmode=require

# API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Security
SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
LOG_LEVEL=warn

# Optional (recommended for production)
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-instance
SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-server
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@domain.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Regular Updates
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Apply security patches promptly
- Use `npm audit` regularly

### 2. Monitoring
- Set up application monitoring
- Monitor authentication events
- Track failed login attempts
- Monitor API usage patterns

### 3. Backup & Recovery
- Regular database backups
- Test backup restoration
- Document recovery procedures
- Implement data retention policies

### 4. Code Security
- Regular security code reviews
- Use static analysis tools
- Implement automated testing
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## Security Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Run security audit
npm audit

# Run linting with security rules
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

### Manual Security Testing

1. **Authentication Testing**
   - Test password complexity requirements
   - Verify rate limiting functionality
   - Test session management
   - Verify logout functionality

2. **Authorization Testing**
   - Test protected route access
   - Verify role-based permissions
   - Test API endpoint security

3. **Input Validation Testing**
   - Test XSS prevention
   - Test SQL injection prevention
   - Test file upload security
   - Test parameter tampering

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Assess the scope
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Review logs and monitoring data
   - Identify attack vectors
   - Assess data exposure
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore services
   - Reset compromised credentials
   - Update security measures

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Update security policies
   - Improve monitoring
   - Provide training
   - Document lessons learned
